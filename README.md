My friend [Felix Dahlstr√∂m Persson](http://felixdahlstrom.com/) attends Kunstakademiet in Oslo, Norway. He sometimes uses the school's scanner to scan drawings that he makes. This repo contains a Node.js application that automatically uploads these scanned documents to Felix portfolio.

**Find out what is currently being scanned at [felixdahlstrom.com/scanned](http://felixdahlstrom.com/scanned)**

How does it work?
-----------------
Step 1. Felix makes a drawing.   
Step 2. Felix scans the drawing using the school's scanner.   
Step 3. The scanner sends the scanned document to a Gmail adress.   
Step 4. The application listens for new emails via a Google Cloud subscription.   
Step 5. The incoming email and the attached document is fetched using the Gmail API.   
Step 6. The attached document is uploaded to DatoCMS to be displayed in Felix portfolio.
